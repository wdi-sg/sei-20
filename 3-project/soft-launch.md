# Soft Launch

### Please have your projects in a working state.

- we will be scheduling times for you to show your project during that day.

- the best way to keep things in a working state is to make a soft-launch release branch. Freeze your code for soft-launch once you've reached your MVP.

- If you need to keep working, make another branch to get back to after doing the soft launch.
