# Soft Launch

### Please have your projects in a working state.

#### Make a branch for your MVP soft-launch version and make sure you can run it.

- we will be scheduling times for you to show your project during that day.

- If you need to keep working, take note of a working commit so that you can refer back to in when doing the soft launch.
